# ManualOS backend

Node/Express API for [ManualOS](https://manualos.com). It opens Stripe Checkout, checks that a checkout is still paid, and generates a PLC operator-manual PDF.

The website is a separate static site (`op3x/matrixmanual-frontend`). This service only serves the API. Production is `https://manualforge-backend-production.up.railway.app`.

## Pricing

- **Starter** is a $39 one-time payment. It includes `STARTER_CREDITS` manuals (default 3). `POST /jobs` reserves one credit when the job starts and refunds it if generation fails. `POST /generate-manual` still increments `manuals_used` only after a PDF is produced.
- **Pro** is a $79 monthly subscription. Generation stays available while that subscription's status is `active` or `trialing`.

## API

### `POST /create-checkout-session`

Request JSON: `{ "plan": "starter" }` or `{ "plan": "pro" }`.

Response JSON: `{ "url": "<hosted Checkout URL>" }`.

Starter uses Checkout `mode: "payment"` and `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER`. Pro uses `mode: "subscription"` and `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO` (a recurring monthly price). Session metadata is `{ plan }`. Redirects:

- success: `${FRONTEND_URL}/upload.html?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
- cancel: `${FRONTEND_URL}/#pricing`

### `GET /verify-session?session_id=cs_...`

Response JSON: `{ "valid": boolean, "plan": "starter" | "pro" | null, "remaining": number | null }`.

Starter is valid when the Checkout Session `payment_status` is `paid`. `remaining` is `STARTER_CREDITS` minus `manuals_used`. Pro is valid when the session's subscription status is `active` or `trialing`, and `remaining` is `null` (unlimited). A paid Starter session with zero manuals left is still `valid: true` with `remaining: 0`; generation then returns 402.

### `POST /jobs`

Preferred upload. Multipart fields `file` and/or `files` (up to 25), plus `session_id` (form field or `X-Session-Id`). Optional fields: `brand`, `manufacturer_name`, `manufacturer_address`, `product_name`, `model`, `doc_number`, `revision`, `language`.

`202` JSON:

```json
{ "id": "job_…", "status": "queued", "progress": { "stage": "queued", "percent": 0, "message": "…" }, "error": null, "warnings": [], "coverage": null, "createdAt": "…", "expiresAt": "…" }
```

Poll `GET /jobs/:id` until `status` is `succeeded` or `failed`. `GET /jobs/:id/pdf` returns `application/pdf` when the job succeeded, `409` when it is not ready, and `404` when the id is unknown or older than 24 hours. Stages are `queued`, `parsing`, `analyzing`, `assembling`, `rendering`, `done`, and `failed`.

Accepted content, detected from the bytes rather than the extension: Rockwell L5X and L5K, Rockwell ACD (converted to L5X with the vendored Apache-2.0 `acd-tools` package; a routine the converter cannot read is named in the manual), Siemens SIMATIC ML block XML (LAD, FBD, SCL, GRAPH, and statement list), Siemens SCL/ST and DATA_BLOCK source, Siemens STL/AWL (S7-300/400 and S7-200), PLCopen XML, TwinCAT TcPOU, CSV and XLSX tag lists, STEP, IGES, ASCII or binary DXF, and ASCII or binary STL (size and approximate shape only). A Zip may contain those files. `.zap` / `.ap` / `.s7p`, `.dwg`, and SolidWorks `.sldprt` / `.sldasm` / `.slddrw` are rejected with the export to use instead (SCL or SIMATIC ML XML, DXF, or STEP). Unknown or mismatched content returns **415**. A file that parses but contains no equipment data returns **422**. Neither spends a credit. Executable uploads are rejected. Zip entries are checked for path traversal, nesting, file count, and uncompressed size.

ACD conversion needs `python3` on PATH. Nixpacks installs it next to Node. The Python packages are vendored under `third_party/python` so the image does not download them at runtime. See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

One failed model chunk does not fail the job. The manual is still built from the parsed project, and coverage must account for every rung or statement.

### `POST /generate-manual`

Kept for the current site. Same body as before (`file`, or JSON `plcContent`, plus `session_id`). Success is `application/pdf` with `Deprecation: true` and `Link: </jobs>; rel="successor-version"`. The Starter counter increments only after the PDF is sent. A missing model key returns **503** and does not spend a credit.

### `POST /webhook`

Raw JSON body. The route verifies `Stripe-Signature` with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and logs the event. Requests with a bad or missing signature get `400`.

Each generate call re-reads the Checkout Session, PaymentIntent, and Subscription, so access stays correct even if a webhook is delayed. The endpoint is still required: subscription renewals, cancellations, and delayed payment methods are asynchronous, and the signature is what shows the call came from Stripe.

### `GET /health`

`{ "status": "ok", "service": "manualos-backend", "aiEnabled": boolean }`.

Errors returned to browsers are short JSON messages. Stack traces stay in the server log.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local runs. Set the same names on Railway. Never commit real keys.

| Variable | Required | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes, to generate manuals | Anthropic Messages API key |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | No | Model id. Default `claude-haiku-5-5` |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | Stripe secret or restricted key |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Yes | Signing secret for `/webhook` |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER` | Yes | Price id for the $39 one-time Starter price |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO` | Yes | Price id for the $79/month Pro price |
| `STARTER_CREDITS` | No | Manuals included with Starter. Default `3` |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Yes in production | Site origin, for example `https://manualos.com` |
| `PORT` | No | Railway sets this. Local default `3001` |
| `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` | No | Chrome or Chromium used to render the PDF. On Railway, Nixpacks installs `chromium` and the server finds it on `PATH`. |

`STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is not read by this server. Hosted Checkout only needs the URL returned by `/create-checkout-session`. The old `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` variable is unused.

When `FRONTEND_URL` is missing and `NODE_ENV` or `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` is `production`, the process logs a fatal error and exits. In any other environment it logs a warning and still boots.

Browser CORS allows the origin of `FRONTEND_URL` and `https://www.manualos.com`.

## Stripe setup

Do this in the Stripe Dashboard (or with the CLI against your own account). This repository does not create prices or webhook endpoints.

1. Create a Product named **ManualOS Starter** with one one-time Price of **$39 USD**. Copy that price id into `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER`.
2. Create a separate Product named **ManualOS Pro** with one recurring Price of **$79 USD** billed **monthly**. Copy that price id into `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO`. Separate products keep the Checkout line item names distinct.
3. Add a webhook endpoint:
   `https://manualforge-backend-production.up.railway.app/webhook`
   Subscribe to `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`, `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `charge.refunded`, `charge.dispute.created`, and `radar.early_fraud_warning.created`.
   Copy the signing secret into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
4. Create a restricted API key that can write Checkout Sessions, read and update PaymentIntents, and read Subscriptions. Store it as `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in Railway. A secret key works too. Use a different key for test and live mode.

Starter stays valid while the Checkout Session is `paid`. Stripe does not change that status when you later refund the charge, so a refunded Starter purchase can still generate until refunds are handled explicitly. Pro access follows the live subscription status, so a cancellation takes effect on the next generate call once the status is no longer `active` or `trialing`.

Stripe Tax is left off. If you sell to US or EU customers, enable [Stripe Tax for recurring payments](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes.md) only after the account has an active registration. Turning on automatic tax without a registration collects no tax and returns no error.

## Model

The default model is Claude Haiku 5.5, id `claude-haiku-5-5` ([model page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/models/haiku-5-5/overview)). `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` is retired. Haiku 5.5 requests use `output_config.effort: "low"` and `thinking: { "type": "disabled" }` so routine summaries stay cheap, and the server reads `text` content blocks rather than assuming the first block is text. The client is `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 1.3 with Node's native `fetch`. SDK 0.20 bundled `node-fetch` and closed gzip responses early. A failed chunk is retried, then replaced by a deterministic grouping of the parsed rungs. The job still fails, and a reserved credit is refunded, if those groups do not cover every rung. Override the id with `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (for example `claude-sonnet-5-5` when you want a larger model).

## Local development

Requires Node.js 20 or newer (Stripe Node SDK 23).

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

`npm test` runs the API tests with a mocked Stripe client and a mocked model. It does not call Stripe or Anthropic.
